    <h1>Top Web Host</h1>
    <h2>Godaddy</h2>
    <li>Godaddy is ranked the top web host because of its multiple hosting services and their great prices. They also have many extra options that would make running a website much easier and end up looking better. The most influential aspect of GoDaddy’s hosting services compared to the other hosting services was GoDaddy’s website, it was by far my favorite very easy to navigate and it looked really nice.

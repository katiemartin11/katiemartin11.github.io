    <h1>Two Good</h1>

        This is probably my favorite website, the way it moves is so cool to watch. The source code is doctype HTML, I assume this is the most modern coding there is. This layout makes a lot of sense to me it is 1 column thought the page. This allows for a lot of space so the design is very obvious and the main attraction. The scrolling effect when you click on one of the products is my favorite part it moves in a way I cant even describe. Navigating through the page is very easy the menu is very simple. The main colors of the page are white black and gray, these colors help encapsulate the colors that apple products produce. This is the most organized and clean looking website available in my opinion which makes it stand out against the rest.

        Overall this website is very nice because of how clean and sleek it looks. It is not crowded with information it’s spread out nicely. The source code says that it uses HTML and looks modern but then again I also don’t know what non-modern code looks like. The layout of the website is very practical on the home page there are 2 columns but then when you click on a section it turns into 3 columns. There are no scrolling effects besides the navigation menu moves down the page while scrolling. It is very easy to navigate, the only thing is when you click on a product and then you hit the back tab after you are done looking at it, it goes to the top of the page not where you left off which is very frustrating when online shopping. The majority of their page is white and black which works well with their products because most of them are very colorful so it adds a nice contrast. The buttons that are the links on the main page are rounded which is a cool feature. I really like this website.

        This is the website that I dislike because it has too much going on and doesn’t seemed to be organized in the slightest. The source code is in HTML, overall it looks organized and modern but even in the code, it seems like there is a lot going on. The layout of this website is very dependent on what section you are on sometimes there are 3 columns other times there are one or two. There are no specific scrolling effects besides the fact that sometimes the screen jumps around because of random new adds that pop up. It is not the easiest to navigate one because of the point I just stated also there are just a lot of options to click on the menu so it’s not simple. The home page also does not seem to have a specific content it is all over. The main colors of the website are red white and black which I feel are compatible and are probably the only cohesive part of this site. This website always has something moving and it is definitely not boring.

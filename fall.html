            <h3>Fall</h3>
            <p>Fall, also known as Autumn in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. One of its main features in temperate climates is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.

            <h3>Etymology</h3><img src=fall.jepg.jpeg>
            <p>
                The word autumn /ˈɔːtəm/ is derived from Latin autumnus, archaic auctumnus, possibly from the ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.Alternative etymologies include Proto-Indo-European *h₃ewǵ- (“cold”) or *h₂sows- (“dry”).

            <h3>Halloween</h3>
            <p>
                Autumn is associated with Halloween (influenced by Samhain, a Celtic autumn festival), and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. Halloween, October 31, is in autumn in the northern hemisphere. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from late August or early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.
